Question:
I have an application that involves frontend service and backend service. Frontend interacts with backend. In the frontend for a given source code repository, we provide the score. Frontend calls backend to get the score. Backend calculates score based on if the given project follows trunk-based development or not. It uses BitBuckets API to fetch commit history and does the calculation. Frontend is developed in ReactJS whereas backend is a python based Rest service. Both the services are deployed in OpenShift.
I need to write technical documentation for this solution that includes both frontend service and backend services. Help me with structure of the documentation. Audience for the documentation is developers.

   - **Technologies Used**: Mention the key technologies used: ReactJS for the frontend, Python for the backend, Bitbucket’s API for commit history, and OpenShift for deployment.
   - **Target Audience**: Clarify that the audience is developers.

### 2. **System Architecture**
   - **High-level Architecture Diagram**: Show how the frontend and backend interact, including deployment in OpenShift.
   - **Components Overview**:
     - **Frontend**: Describe the ReactJS-based frontend, its role in sending requests to the backend, and how the data is displayed.
     - **Backend**: Explain the Python REST API's responsibilities, including fetching data from Bitbucket and calculating the score.
   - **Communication between Frontend and Backend**: Describe the interaction model (e.g., REST API calls, response formats, and error handling).

### 3. **Frontend Service**
   - **Technology Stack**: ReactJS, any major libraries or frameworks used.
   - **Key Functionalities**:
     - User input for the source code repository.
     - Triggering the backend API to fetch the score.
     - Displaying the calculated score to the user.
   - **Component Breakdown**:
     - List the main React components and their roles.
   - **API Integration**:
     - Explain how the frontend sends requests to the backend, with example code snippets for making API calls (e.g., using `fetch` or `axios`).
     - Error handling on the frontend.
   - **User Interface (UI)**:
     - Briefly describe the key UI elements for interacting with the backend and showing the score.

### 4. **Backend Service**
   - **Technology Stack**: Python, REST API, Bitbucket API, OpenShift deployment.
   - **API Overview**:
     - **Endpoints**: List the available endpoints, their request methods (e.g., `POST`, `GET`), and expected input/output. Provide examples of request/response payloads.
     - **Bitbucket API Integration**: Explain how the backend fetches commit history using Bitbucket’s API.
     - **Score Calculation Logic**: Detail the algorithm used to calculate whether the project follows trunk-based development.
     - **Error Handling**: How errors from Bitbucket API or calculation issues are handled.
   - **Code Structure**:
     - Overview of the key Python modules and functions used.
   - **Security Considerations**:
     - API authentication and security best practices for communication between services.

### 5. **Deployment Details**
   - **OpenShift Overview**: Describe the OpenShift platform and its role in hosting both the frontend and backend services.
   - **Deployment Configuration**:
     - How the frontend and backend are deployed (containers, pods, etc.).
     - Key configuration files (e.g., Dockerfiles, YAML files).
   - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Explain any automated deployment pipelines used (e.g., building, testing, and deploying using OpenShift's tools).
   - **Scaling and Load Balancing**: How OpenShift handles scaling and load balancing between services.

### 6. **Testing**
   - **Unit and Integration Testing**:
     - Frontend: Describe how components are tested, including mock API calls.
     - Backend: Outline how the REST API and its interaction with Bitbucket’s API are tested.
   - **End-to-End Testing**: Testing the entire workflow from frontend to backend to score calculation.
   - **Automated Tests**: Explain any automation in the test suite (e.g., tools like Jest, PyTest).

### 7. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - **Frontend**: How the frontend handles errors (e.g., API failures, UI notifications).
   - **Backend**: Logging and error-handling mechanisms in place, including how errors from the Bitbucket API are dealt with.
   - **Monitoring and Alerting**: If relevant, explain how errors and issues are tracked in production (e.g., using monitoring tools integrated with OpenShift).

### 8. **Security Considerations**
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: How authentication is handled (e.g., OAuth for Bitbucket).
   - **Data Security**: How data is secured in transit and at rest between services.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: How access to OpenShift resources is managed.

### 9. **Future Enhancements**
   - **Potential Improvements**: Any potential extensions or optimizations for the frontend, backend, or deployment.
   - **Scalability Considerations**: What to consider for scaling the system as more users or repositories are added.

### 10. **Appendices**
   - **API Reference**: Detailed list of all the API calls with their parameters, request bodies, and response structures.
   - **Useful Links and Resources**: Links to Bitbucket API documentation, ReactJS, OpenShift, etc.

This structure gives a thorough guide for developers to understand the architecture, functionality, and deployment of your solution. Would you like help fleshing out any particular section?
